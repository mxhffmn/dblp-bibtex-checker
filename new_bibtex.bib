We revisit the approach to semi-supervised learning with generative models and develop new models that allow for effective generalisation from small labelled data sets to large unlabelled ones. Generative approaches have thus far been either inflexible, inefficient or non-scalable. We show that deep generative models and approximate Bayesian inference exploiting recent advances in variational methods can be used to provide significant improvements, making generative approaches highly competitive for semi-supervised learning.",

We demonstrate this model using a graph convolutional network (GCN) encoder and a simple inner product decoder. Our model achieves competitive results on a link prediction task in citation networks. In contrast to most existing models for unsupervised learning on graph-structured data and link prediction, our model can naturally incorporate node features, which significantly improves predictive performance on a number of benchmark datasets.",

    abstract = "We introduce twin neural network (TNN) regression. This method predicts differences between the target values of two different data points rather than the targets themselves. The solution of a traditional regression problem is then obtained by averaging over an ensemble of all predicted differences between the targets of an unseen data point and all training data points. Whereas ensembles are normally costly to produce, TNN regression intrinsically creates an ensemble of predictions of twice the size of the training set while only training a single neural network. Since ensembles have been shown to be more accurate than single models this property naturally transfers to TNN regression. We show that TNNs are able to compete or yield more accurate predictions for different data sets, compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, TNN regression is constrained by self-consistency conditions. We find that the violation of these conditions provides an estimate for the prediction uncertainty.",

    abstract = "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have been widely used in modeling and generating graphs with latent factors. However, there is no clear explanation of what these latent factors are and why they perform well. In this work, we present Dirichlet Graph Variational Autoencoder (DGVAE) with graph cluster memberships as latent factors. Our study connects VAEs based graph generation and balanced graph cut, and provides a new way to understand and improve the internal mechanism of VAEs based graph generation. Specifically, we first interpret the reconstruction term of DGVAE as balanced graph cut in a principled way. Furthermore, motivated by the low pass characteristics in balanced graph cut, we propose a new variant of GNN named Heatts to encode the input graph into cluster memberships. Heatts utilizes the Taylor series for fast computation of heat kernels and has better low pass characteristics than Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). Through experiments on graph generation and graph clustering, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.",

We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.",

Our main theorem characterizes the permutation invariant functions and provides a family of functions to which any permutation invariant objective function must belong. This family of functions has a special structure which enables us to design a deep network architecture that can operate on sets and which can be deployed on a variety of scenarios including both unsupervised and supervised learning tasks. We also derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for permutation equivariance in deep models. We demonstrate the applicability of our method on population statistic estimation, point cloud classification, set expansion, and outlier detection.",
